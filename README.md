# ALX Project Nexus

Welcome to **Project Nexus** â€“ a documentation hub capturing the core learnings, skills, and insights from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**. This repository serves as both a personal reference and a public showcase of my growth throughout the program.

---

## Program Overview

The **ProDev Frontend Engineering** program is an intensive, hands-on learning experience focused on building production-ready applications using modern frontend tools and technologies. Through collaborative projects, individual assignments, and peer-learning, I gained both technical skills and practical experience crucial for a frontend engineering role.

## ðŸ”§ Major Learnings

###  Key Technologies Covered
- **Next.js** â€“ React framework for building scalable, performant, and SEO-friendly web apps.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript** â€“ Typed superset of JavaScript enabling better tooling and maintainability.
- **GraphQL** â€“ Query language for APIs and runtime to fetch exactly what is needed.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** â€“ Techniques to build web apps that work offline and feel like native apps.
- **Mobile Development** â€“ Frontend principles for creating responsive and mobile-first applications.
